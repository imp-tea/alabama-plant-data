Plant Name: Red Maple (Acer rubrum)
General Description: A medium-sized deciduous tree 40–60 ft tall (up to ~90 ft in ideal conditions) with a rounded crown. Named for its red features – red buds, red spring flowers, and often bright red fall foliage. Bark is smooth and gray on young trees, becoming darker and ridged with age.
Notable Characteristics: Highly adaptable and one of the most common trees in the Eastern U.S. It’s sometimes called “swamp maple” because it grows in wetlands, yet it also tolerates uplands. In central Alabama it adds brilliant fall color (yellow-orange to scarlet) and provides early-spring blooms. The tiny red flower clusters appear in late winter *before* the leaves, making entire trees glow red. It is a relatively fast-growing tree but comparatively short-lived for a maple.
Preferred Environmental Conditions: Thrives in moist, well-drained soils – commonly in stream bottoms, swamp edges, and wet woods. Also grows on upland slopes and in mixed forests. Tolerates periodic flooding as well as moderately dry soils once established. It can grow in full sun or partial shade. Because it is so adaptable (soil pH, moisture, etc.), red maple has expanded in many southeastern forests in the absence of fire.
Reproductive Method and Timing: Wind-pollinated (with some insect help). It flowers very early (as early as February) with small red tassel-like blooms that are an important nectar source for bees. Being one of the first bloomers, its red flowers are pollinated by early-emerging native bees and other insects, and also by wind. Red maple is *dioecious or polygamdioecious* – many trees are either male or female, though some have both flower sexes. Female trees produce masses of paired winged seeds (“samaras”) that ripen and drop in late spring (April–May of the same spring they flower). The lightweight samaras twirl down and are dispersed by wind – often germinating immediately. Red maples start seed production at a young age (as early as 4–8 years old) and can produce abundant crops almost every year.
Lifespan: Relatively short-lived for a canopy tree. Typically 80–100 years is old for red maple, though occasionally they reach 150. Because they grow fast, they often succumb to heart rot or storm damage in later age.
Major Mutualistic/Parasitic Relationships: **Early spring nectar** – its tiny red flowers are a critical early food for honeybees and native bees when few other blooms are available. Red maple seeds are eaten by squirrels and some songbirds (finches, titmice) in spring. Young shoots and leaves are a minor browse for deer. Red maple can develop **hollow cavities** that provide dens for wildlife in older trees. The tree is prone to certain fungal diseases (like maple anthracnose) in very wet springs and can suffer from Asian invasive pests (e.g. Asian longhorned beetle if introduced). Overall, it plays a supporting role in forest ecosystems by bridging wet and dry habitats and by feeding early-season pollinators.
