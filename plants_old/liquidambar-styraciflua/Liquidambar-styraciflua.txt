Plant Name: Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua)
General Description: A medium-to-large deciduous hardwood reaching 60–75 ft (occasionally 100 ft) with a straight trunk and pyramidal crown when young, becoming more rounded with age. Leaves are star-shaped (5 pointed lobes) and aromatic when crushed. In fall, the foliage turns brilliant yellow, orange, red, or purple. The fruits are spiky spherical “gumballs” about 1–1.5″ in diameter.
Notable Characteristics: Common in bottomlands and disturbed areas throughout central Alabama. It’s an early-successional tree that rapidly colonizes old fields and clearings. Sweetgum is known for its hard, spiky seed pods that litter the ground. Its sap was used historically as “storax” resin. The wood is used for plywood and furniture.
Preferred Environmental Conditions: Thrives on moist, clay or loamy soils – often along streams and in wet bottomlands. Tolerates temporary flooding, but not prolonged inundation. Also grows (less vigorously) on drier upland sites after disturbances. Prefers full sun. Fire-intolerant (thin-barked): frequent fire regimes prevent sweetgum from dominating, whereas fire suppression has allowed it to increase in many areas.
Reproductive Method and Timing: Wind-pollinated. Trees are monoecious; inconspicuous greenish flower clusters bloom in spring. Females develop into green spiky globes that mature by fall of the same year. A single “gumball” fruit contains many tiny winged seeds that are released in fall and through winter. Trees begin producing seeds by ~20–30 years of age and can produce viable seed for at least 150 years. Light seeds are dispersed primarily by wind, usually falling within 200 ft of the parent, though some may be carried further or eaten by birds.
Lifespan: Can live 150 years or more under favorable conditions. Many wild trees probably age out around 100–150 years; older trees often hollow out.
Major Mutualistic/Parasitic Relationships: Sweetgum’s abundant seeds are eaten by some birds (e.g. goldfinches, chickadees) and small mammals, though it’s not a top wildlife food source. Its florets provide pollen for generalist bees and flies in spring. In forests, sweetgum stands offer cover for wildlife. The tree can be a host for *Liquidambar formosana* scale insects and other sapfeeders, but it is most notably susceptible to **mistletoe** infestation (parasitic mistletoe often grows on mature sweetgums). Sweetgum resin has antimicrobial properties (a folk medicine trait), which may help the tree resist some pests. **Note:** The hard gum balls are not eaten by most animals, allowing many seeds to simply disseminate by wind.
