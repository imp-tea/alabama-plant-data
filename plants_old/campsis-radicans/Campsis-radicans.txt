Plant Name: Trumpet Creeper (Campsis radicans) – also called Trumpet Vine
General Description: A vigorous deciduous vine with compound leaves (7–15 leaflets) and bright orange to red trumpet-shaped flowers in summer. It climbs by aerial rootlets and can reach 30–40 ft high, often covering fences or growing up trees. In late summer it produces long slender pods (3–6″) containing winged seeds. Trumpet creeper is native to the Southeast and is known for attracting hummingbirds.
Notable Characteristics: A spectacular **hummingbird plant** – its tubular orange flowers (about 3″ long) are perfectly shaped and timed for the ruby-throated hummingbird, which migrates through and breeds in Alabama. In fact, its blooming (June–August) overlaps with peak hummingbird activity, and it’s a primary nectar source. The vine is fast-growing and can be aggressive (it suckers and spreads), sometimes considered a bit weedy, but it’s highly valued in natural settings for wildlife. Its foliage can cause mild skin irritation in some people (hence one nickname “cow-itch vine”).
Preferred Environmental Conditions: Full sun for best flowering, though it will grow in partial shade (but flower less). Typically found in **open woods, along roadsides, fencerows**, and edges of ponds. Tolerates a range of soils – sandy, loam, clay – as long as it’s not waterlogged. Fairly drought-tolerant once established. Often seen climbing on old fences, utility poles, or at forest margins where light is available. It can colonize disturbed ground quickly via suckers.
Reproductive Method and Timing: Blooms throughout summer (June to early September). The bright orange-red trumpet flowers are loaded with nectar and **primarily pollinated by Ruby-throated Hummingbirds** (its principal pollinator). Other visitors include bumblebees (which sometimes rob nectar from the base) and butterflies, but hummingbirds are most effective – they carry pollen on their foreheads from flower to flower. Fertilized blooms develop into bean-like seed pods by late summer. These pods turn brown and split open in autumn, releasing papery two-winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. The vine also spreads vegetatively: it produces suckers from the roots and can form colonies. Cut stems resprout readily from the base or roots.
Lifespan: Long-lived vine; individual clumps can persist for decades (50+ years) continually sending up new shoots. Old vines become woody and thick. It’s a survivor plant – once established, it’s hard to get rid of.
Major Mutualistic/Parasitic Relationships: **Hummingbird mutualism:** Trumpet creeper and ruby-throated hummingbirds have a classic mutualistic relationship – the vine provides copious nectar for the hummingbirds, and in return the hummingbirds effectively pollinate the plant while feeding. Many a hummingbird nest is also hidden in nearby trees where trumpet creeper blooms provide a convenient food source. Butterflies and long-tongued bees also benefit from its nectar (though the flower’s design favors hummingbirds). The dense tangles of trumpet vine offer nesting cover for some birds and are often used by Carolina wrens and others for sheltered nesting or roosting. Its foliage is a host for the Trumpet Vine Sphinx moth’s larvae (Paratrea plebeja) and possibly other moths, contributing to insect diversity. Conversely, the vine’s rapid growth can make it something of a “parasite” in cultivated gardens (overrunning structures), but in the wild it’s kept in check by competition and sometimes by grazing (deer will nibble new shoots lightly, and cattle/goats will eat it). Some ants may visit extra-floral nectaries on the plant or feed on the pod juices, but no significant pests plague it. In summary, trumpet creeper plays a strongly positive role in native ecosystems by **providing abundant nectar to pollinators (especially hummingbirds) and food for larvae**, with minimal downside. It can be aggressive, but in natural balance, it coexists as a key component of “hummingbird highways.”
