Plant Name: Kudzu (Pueraria montana var. lobata) – *Invasive*
General Description: A rampant woody vine (legume family) notorious for its aggressive growth. Kudzu can climb 60+ ft, smothering trees, power poles, buildings – essentially anything in its path. It has large trifoliate leaves (three broad leaflets) and in late summer produces purple pea-like flower clusters with a grape-Jelly scent. It forms hairy brown seed pods. Kudzu was introduced from Asia and has become a pervasive invasive vine across Alabama, earning the nickname “the vine that ate the South.”
Notable Characteristics: **Extreme growth rate** – in peak summer it can grow up to a foot per day, quickly covering structures. It forms thick mats and curtains that can choke out forests. Being a legume, kudzu roots possess nodules with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, allowing it to enrich poor soils and outcompete other plants. The vine has semi-woody stems that can reach several inches thick at the base. It dies back in winter but resprouts vigorously each spring from massive tuberous roots. Fragrant purple flowers appear in late July–August but not all infestations flower if frequently mown.
Preferred Environmental Conditions: Open sunlight and disturbed ground – thrives along roadsides, field edges, forest clearings. Prefers well-drained loam or clay; does not like waterlogged soil. Very drought-tolerant once established (deep roots). Found a lot on slopes and marginal lands. In shade it will grow but more slowly. Essentially, any warm, sunny area in central Alabama with seasonal moisture is susceptible to kudzu colonization.
Reproductive Method and Timing: Spreads primarily vegetatively. Kudzu vines root readily at the nodes when they contact soil, creating new rooted crowns. It also extends by runners. Flowering occurs in mid to late summer (July/August) with purple flower clusters that are **bee-pollinated** (and visited by other insects, even hummingbirds for nectar) – the blossoms smell of artificial grape. These yield brown, hairy seed pods by fall. However, in the Southeast, seed viability is relatively low and many patches rarely produce mature seeds. Nonetheless, one plant can produce hundreds of seeds, and some seeds remain viable in soil for years. The main spread mechanism is via vine expansion and human movement of root cuttings (or contaminated soil). Kudzu’s root system is robust – a single root crown can weigh hundreds of pounds and send dozens of vines outward. Cutting the vines only top-kills; the root must be destroyed to kill the plant.
Lifespan: Essentially indefinite as a clonal colony. Individual vines can live many years (decades), and the root crowns continually produce new vines. Some kudzu root systems are known to be over 50 years old.
Major Mutualistic/Parasitic Relationships: Kudzu’s impact is largely **parasitic to ecosystems** – it overwhelms native vegetation by sheer coverage, blocking light and stealing resources. However, being a legume, it does have a mutualistic relation with **rhizobia bacteria** in its roots that fix nitrogen, enriching the soil significantly (in fact, kudzu invasion can nearly double soil nitrogen content, altering ecosystems). Some generalist pollinators utilize kudzu’s summer blooms – honeybees and native bees collect nectar/pollen from the purple flowers, and it can provide a late-summer nectar flow for bees. Also, **kudzu is actually eaten by some animals**: goats and cattle will graze kudzu readily (farmers have used goats to control it), and the introduced *kudzu bug* (Megacopta) feeds on its sap. Deer occasionally browse the tender leaves and blossoms. A few native insects have adapted somewhat: e.g. summer cicadas use kudzu thickets as habitat, and some moths may feed on it opportunistically. But no specialist native herbivore controls it. So while kudzu can offer temporary nectar to bees and forage to livestock, it mostly competes with native plants. Its mutualism is mainly with humans who planted it (historically for erosion control) and with its rhizobial bacteria that allow it to thrive on poor soils. In Alabama’s wild, kudzu is essentially a persistent, invasive “parasite” of entire plant communities, requiring concerted efforts to eradicate.
