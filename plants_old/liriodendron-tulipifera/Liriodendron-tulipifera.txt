Plant Name: Tulip Poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) – also called Yellow Poplar
General Description: One of the tallest native hardwoods, reaching 90–120 ft with a straight columnar trunk and narrow crown. Leaves are distinctively four-lobed (tulip-shaped) and turn golden yellow in fall. In late spring it bears tulip-like, greenish-yellow flowers with orange centers. Despite the name, it’s actually in the Magnolia family, not a true poplar.
Notable Characteristics: Grows very rapidly on good sites and is often one of the first large trees to colonize clearings (a pioneer species). Because it can achieve great height, it often persists into mature forests as an emergent canopy tree. The flowers are showy but high in the tree and thus sometimes missed. The soft wood is valued for timber (used in furniture, plywood, etc.).
Preferred Environmental Conditions: Prefers deep, rich, moist soils – commonly found in sheltered coves, lower slopes, and along streams. It thrives in mesic conditions with full sun above (intolerant of deep shade). It is absent from sites with frequent fire or prolonged flooding. In central Alabama it grows in bottomlands and moist uplands.
Reproductive Method and Timing: Primarily insect-pollinated. Blooms in late spring (typically April–May) with large nectar-rich blossoms that attract bees, beetles, and especially long-tongued bees and hummingbirds. Trees start flowering around 10–15 years old. After pollination, each flower develops into a cone-like aggregate of winged seeds that ripen by autumn and are shed over fall and winter. Seeds are wind-dispersed but have low viability (only 5–20% germinate). Nevertheless, seed production continues for over 200 years on large trees.
Lifespan: Long-lived for a pioneer species. Often 150–250 years; exceptional trees can approach 300 years. Fast initial growth means many reach large size early, though they can succumb to rot or storms in old age.
Major Mutualistic/Parasitic Relationships: Tulip poplar’s nectar-rich flowers are a boon for pollinators – they attract **beetles, bumblebees, honeybees, and even ruby-throated hummingbirds**. The tree provides one of the first big honey flows for bees in late spring. Its winged seeds are eaten by some birds (e.g. cardinals, finches, chickadees) and small mammals, though they are not a preferred food. The foliage is a host for certain moths (like the tuliptree silkmoth and tiger swallowtail butterfly larvae). Tulip poplar is fairly resistant to pests, but older trees can get leaf spots or weevils in cones. Deer may browse seedlings lightly, but rapid growth often outpaces browsing.
