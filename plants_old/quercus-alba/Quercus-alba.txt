Plant Name: White Oak (Quercus alba)
General Description: A majestic deciduous oak reaching 60–100 ft with a broad, rounded crown and light ashy-gray, scaly bark. Leaves are 5–9 inches long with 7–9 rounded lobes and whitish underside. Renowned for its strength, longevity, and beautiful fall colors (reddish-purple to brown).
Notable Characteristics: One of the longest-lived and largest Eastern oaks – often called the “king of trees.” It can live for centuries, providing stable habitat over long periods. Acorns of white oak mature in one season and germinate soon after falling. The wood is dense, durable, and was historically important (e.g. barrels, shipbuilding).
Preferred Environmental Conditions: Grows best in deep, fertile, well-drained loamy soils with full to partial sun. Common in mesic hardwood forests. Tolerates a range of conditions, from moist bottomlands to drier uplands, but not extreme wet or very poor dry sand. Prefers slightly acidic soil and is moderately drought-tolerant once established.
Reproductive Method and Timing: Wind-pollinated. Flowers in spring (April) when leaves emerge – male flowers in dangling catkins, female flowers small in leaf axils. Acorns mature within a single growing season and drop in fall (Sept–Nov). Trees start producing acorns around 20 years old, but heavy crops begin by ~50 years. Acorns sprout soon after falling, often in autumn.
Lifespan: Very long-lived. Commonly 300+ years; some venerable white oaks can live 400–600 years. Even after the interior rots with age, hollow old oaks can remain standing and habitable for wildlife for many decades.
Major Mutualistic/Parasitic Relationships: A keystone species in Eastern forests. **Acorns are a crucial mast food** relished by countless wildlife – over 80 species of birds and mammals feed on white oak acorns (such as woodpeckers, jays, turkeys, ducks, bears, deer, etc.). The dense canopy and hollow trunks provide shelter and nesting sites (e.g. cavity-nesting birds, squirrels). Oaks support more insect herbivores than any other native tree – hundreds of moth and butterfly caterpillars feed on its foliage, making it a vital link in the food web. In exchange, many of those insects (and their predators) do little lasting harm to the tree. Like other oaks, white oak forms mycorrhizal partnerships in its roots that aid nutrient uptake.
