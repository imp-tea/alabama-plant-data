Plant Name: Flowering Dogwood (Cornus florida)
General Description: A small deciduous understory tree, typically 15–30 ft tall with a broad, layered crown. Famous for its showy “flowers” – which are actually four large white (or pink) bracts surrounding a cluster of tiny yellow true flowers. Blooming in spring, dogwoods light up understories with white blooms before the forest canopy fully leafs out. Leaves are opposite, oval and turn red-purple in fall. Red berry-like drupes form in clusters in late summer.
Notable Characteristics: One of the South’s most cherished ornamentals and a symbol of spring. It is **very shade-tolerant**, naturally found as an understory tree in rich hardwood forests. The bark is dark and broken into small squarish plates. Flowering dogwood is also known for its alligator-skin bark on older trees and its tiered branching structure.
Preferred Environmental Conditions: Partial shade under taller trees or woodland edges. Prefers moist, well-drained, acidic soils rich in organic matter. It does not do well in waterlogged or very dry soils. Common on slopes and bluffs. In cultivation it can grow in full sun if given sufficient moisture, but in nature it’s an understory component. Susceptible to drought and dogwood anthracnose (a fungus) in stressed conditions.
Reproductive Method and Timing: In early to mid-spring, before the canopy leafs out (March–April), dogwoods bloom in a spectacular display. Insect-pollinated – small central flowers offer nectar to early bees and beetles. If pollinated, each flower cluster yields a handful of glossy red drupes by late summer to early fall. Dogwoods begin flowering and fruiting at a young age (~5–10 years old). The seeds within the drupes germinate after fall dispersal, often requiring winter cold (they’ll sprout the next spring).
Lifespan: Generally 80–100 years in natural conditions, though many wild trees die earlier from diseases like anthracnose. Some protected specimens can reach 125+ years.
Major Mutualistic/Parasitic Relationships: **Wildlife bonanza:** Dogwood’s red fruits are a **favorite fall food for birds** – at least 36 species of birds feed on them, including robins, cardinals, bluebirds, cedar waxwings, thrushes, and wild turkeys. Mammals like squirrels and chipmunks also eat the berries. By consuming the high-fat drupes, birds disperse the dogwood’s seeds in their droppings. The flowers, while showy to us, also attract pollinators like small bees and flies in spring. Additionally, dogwood leaves support the larvae of the Spring Azure butterfly and several moths (specialist **dogwood-loving bees** also visit the flowers). On the flip side, flowering dogwood is vulnerable to the fungal disease Dogwood Anthracnose in cool, wet weather – a parasitic fungus that can kill trees (this has significantly reduced understory dogwoods in some areas). It is also host to *dogwood club gall* (caused by a mite), but this is minor. Overall, it is a cornerstone of forest understories, providing food and shelter (its dense branching offers good nesting sites for songbirds).
