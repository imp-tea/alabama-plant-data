Plant Name: Southern Magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora)
General Description: An iconic broadleaf evergreen tree native to the Southeast, reaching 60–80 ft in height with a columnar to pyramidal form. It has thick, leathery, glossy dark-green leaves (often rusty-brown underneath) and produces huge, creamy-white, lemon-scented flowers up to 8–12 inches across in late spring and summer. Its fruits are cone-like structures that release bright red seeds in fall.
Notable Characteristics: **Evergreen foliage** and giant fragrant blossoms make it unmistakable. Often found in lowland forests – it’s adapted to warm, humid climates. The leaves are shed gradually year-round (forming a heavy leaf litter). The tree is relatively slow-growing but long-lived and can develop a massive trunk. Southern magnolia’s showy flowers are primarily pollinated by beetles – magnolias evolved before bees and thus rely on beetle pollinators. The wood is hard and was used historically for furniture.
Preferred Environmental Conditions: Thrives in rich, well-drained yet moist soils – commonly on stream terraces and maritime forests. Prefers full sun to partial shade. Often found in slightly acidic loam or clay. Tolerant of poorly drained, periodically wet sites (like swamps edges) so long as flooding isn’t constant. Also fairly drought-tolerant once established. In central AL, wild magnolias are typically in lower elevations with ample moisture. Can’t withstand severe cold (native range is Zones 7–10).
Reproductive Method and Timing: In late spring (May–June) and sporadically through summer, it opens its enormous white flowers one by one. These flowers are **primarily pollinated by beetles** attracted by the sweet scent and pollen (not much nectar). By late summer, the fertilized flowers develop into reddish cone-like fruiting structures that split to reveal fleshy red seeds. The ripe red seeds hang by threads and are **taken by birds** or drop under the tree. Many birds (e.g. wild turkeys, quail) and small mammals eat these seeds, dispersing them short distances. Trees start flowering at around 10–15 years old and can produce some blooms annually thereafter.
Lifespan: Long-lived – often 100–150 years or more. Some specimens are known to exceed 200 years.
Major Mutualistic/Parasitic Relationships: **Beetle Pollination:** Unlike most trees, magnolia flowers are specially adapted to beetle pollinators (thick petals and lots of pollen). Beetles and some flies feed on pollen and inadvertently pollinate the flowers. The bright red seeds in fall are eaten by birds (such as thrashers, woodpeckers) and by small mammals – these animals help disperse the seeds. Southern magnolia’s dense evergreen canopy provides year-round shelter for birds. Parasitically, it has few serious enemies; however, magnolia scale (an insect) can infest it, and in deep shade it can host sooty mold on leaves. Overall, this magnolia is revered by wildlife for its seeds and by humans for its grand beauty.
