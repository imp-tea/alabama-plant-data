Plant Name: Black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia hirta)
General Description: An iconic native wildflower with bright golden-yellow daisy-like blooms and dark brown (nearly black) central cone “eyes.” Typically grows 1–3 ft tall with rough, hairy leaves and stems. It often behaves as a biennial or short-lived perennial, flowering in its first or second year. Black-eyed Susans are common in prairies, roadsides, and open areas, bringing cheery color in early to mid-summer.
Notable Characteristics: Prolific and long-blooming – a single plant can produce many blooms from late spring through summer. The combination of yellow rays and black center is a classic look in wildflower meadows. It’s the state flower of neighboring Maryland, but Alabama has plenty as well. It self-seeds readily, helping it pop up in disturbed sites. Flowers are attractive to many pollinators, and the seed heads left after blooming provide food for finches and sparrows into fall/winter.
Preferred Environmental Conditions: Full sun. Thrives in **dry to moderately moist prairies, old fields, and roadsides**. It’s adaptable to soils – sandy, loam, even clay – as long as not waterlogged. Tolerates heat and drought well once established, hence common along sunny highways. Often one of the first flowers to colonize disturbed ground (along with grasses). In partial shade it may grow taller and lean but can still bloom.
Reproductive Method and Timing: Blooms typically from late May through July (sometimes with an extended flush into early fall if conditions allow). Pollinated by a wide variety of insects – bees (honeybees, native solitary bees, bumblebees), butterflies, beetles – which seek pollen and sometimes nectar from the disk florets. It’s not unusual to see a coneflower head crawling with small pollinators. After flowering, each dark “eye” is actually a seed head containing dozens of tiny seeds. By late summer and fall, these seeds ripen and can drop or be carried a short distance by wind or rain splash. More importantly, many **birds (especially goldfinches) perch on the cones to eat the seeds** in late summer and fall. In this way, birds also help dislodge and disperse some seeds. Black-eyed Susan often acts as an annual or biennial – it relies on continual reseeding.
Lifespan: Individual plants are short-lived (commonly 1–2 years flowering), but they leave a seed bank that can germinate future generations. In a meadow, you’ll see fluctuating populations, with the species persisting through self-sowing.
Major Mutualistic/Parasitic Relationships: **Pollinator and bird support:** Black-eyed Susans are known to attract a wide range of pollinators, providing nectar and pollen during the summer lull. Bees of all sizes (from tiny sweat bees to larger leaf-cutter bees) visit the blooms, and some specialized native bees (like *Andrena rudbeckiae*) gather pollen only from Rudbeckias and their relatives. Butterflies and moths also nectar at the ray flowers. By feeding these insects, the plant ensures its own pollination – a mutual benefit. After flowering, the seed heads become a natural bird feeder: **finches, sparrows, and other songbirds pick out the seeds**, getting nutrition and incidentally scattering some seeds. Goldfinches in particular often rely on Rudbeckia and coneflower seeds as an important late-summer food (and they even use the plant down in their nests). Thus, Rudbeckia plays a key role in supporting seed-eating bird populations. The plant itself is not much browsed by deer (it has coarse, hairy leaves and a slightly bitter taste, so deer typically avoid it – good for the plant and for gardeners). In terms of pests, black-eyed Susan can occasionally get fungal leaf spots or aphids, but nothing major – it’s hardy. It is moderately **larval host** to a few butterfly/moth species (like Silvery Checkerspot larvae feed on Rudbeckia leaves), which is another contribution to the food web. All said, Black-eyed Susan is a cornerstone of native meadows: **benefiting pollinators with its nectar/pollen and birds with its seeds** – a strongly mutualistic presence in ecosystems.
