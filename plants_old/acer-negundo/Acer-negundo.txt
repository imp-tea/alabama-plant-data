Plant Name: Box Elder (Acer negundo)
General Description: A fast-growing but short-lived maple often considered “weedy.” Reaches 30–50 ft tall (can reach ~80 ft on ideal sites) with an irregular, often leaning form. Unusual for a maple, its leaves are pinnately compound with 3–7 leaflets, resembling ash leaves. Twigs are green with a waxy bloom. Often found as a multi-trunked, thicket-forming tree.
Notable Characteristics: The only maple native to Alabama with compound leaves. It is extremely hardy and adaptable – thriving in disturbed areas, floodplains, and even urban lots. It tends to have brittle wood and is prone to storm damage or trunk rot as it ages. It produces abundant seeds and suckers freely, which is why it volunteers in many places. Because of its rapid growth and tolerance, it’s sometimes planted as a quick shade or windbreak tree despite its messy habits.
Preferred Environmental Conditions: Common along rivers, streams, and lowlands with ample moisture. It tolerates periodic flooding and wet soils, yet also survives in dry, neglected sites. Prefers full sun to light shade. Extremely tolerant of different soil types (clay to sandy) and even alkaline conditions. Highly cold-hardy as well. Box elder often pioneers in disturbed ground with other softwoods.
Reproductive Method and Timing: Primarily by seed. **Dioecious** – male and female flowers on separate trees. In early spring (before leaf-out), male trees produce clusters of yellow-green pollen flowers, and females produce pendent green racemes that will become seeds. Pollination is by wind. The female flowers develop into large clusters of paired *samaras* (winged seeds) that ripen by late summer and often remain on the tree into winter. Box elders start bearing seeds around 10–15 years and can produce huge crops annually until around 75 years old. The winged seeds are dispersed by wind, and also readily transported by water along streams.
Lifespan: Short – typically 60–75 years, rarely up to 100 years in ideal conditions. Many box elders die before that from trunk rot or limb breakage.
Major Mutualistic/Parasitic Relationships: **Wildlife value:** Box elder’s seeds (samaras) are an important winter food for birds like finches and grosbeaks, and for small mammals like squirrels and chipmunks. Its buds and new shoots are occasionally browsed by deer. Dense thickets of box elder along waterways provide cover for wildlife. The tree is also a host for the *Boxelder Bug*, an insect that feeds on its seeds (considered a mild pest when they invade homes). As a fast-growing, early successional tree, box elder often enriches the soil with leaf litter and creates habitat for shade-tolerant plants that follow. It has a symbiotic relationship with *Vermicularia fungus* that causes a distinctive black stain in the wood (not harmful, just cosmetic). In sum, while often maligned, box elder contributes by feeding wildlife (seeds readily eaten by birds) and stabilizing streambanks with its roots.
