Plant Name: Southern Red Oak (Quercus falcata)
General Description: A large deciduous oak of upland forests, 60–80 ft tall (sometimes over 100 ft) with a broad, rounded crown. Leaves are variable – typically 3–5 lobes with bristle tips, dark green above and fuzzy tan beneath. The bark is dark and furrowed. Also known as Spanish Oak.
Notable Characteristics: Tolerant of dry, poor soils (often found on sandy or rocky ridges). Leaves can have two forms – some shaped like a turkey’s foot and others with deeper lobes – often both on the same tree. New foliage is rusty-hairy underneath. It’s valued as a tough landscape oak in the South for hot sites.
Preferred Environmental Conditions: Dry to mesic upland sites. Thrives in well-drained, acidic sandy or gravelly loam. Drought-tolerant once established. It prefers full sun and is moderately fast-growing. Thin bark makes it fire-susceptible, so it’s more common where fires were infrequent.
Reproductive Method and Timing: Wind-pollinated. Male catkins release pollen in spring; inconspicuous female flowers form acorns. Acorns take two growing seasons to mature (typical of red oak group). Trees begin producing acorns around 25 years old, with good crops at 50–75 years. Acorns drop in fall of the second year and germinate the following spring.
Lifespan: Moderate to long. Often lives 100–150 years; exceptional specimens may approach 200. Often shorter-lived on poor, exposed sites or if damaged by rot after fire scars.
Major Mutualistic/Parasitic Relationships: A high-value wildlife tree. Its acorns are an important food for many animals – eaten by songbirds, turkeys, squirrels, deer, and other mammals every autumn. The foliage and twigs are browsed by deer occasionally. Southern red oak is also a **host plant** for numerous moth and butterfly larvae (e.g. hairstreaks and duskywing butterflies), supporting insect populations that in turn feed birds. Like other oaks, it forms symbiotic mycorrhizal partnerships in its roots. It can suffer from **oak wilt** disease (caused by a fungus) in some regions, and older trees may develop heart rot if wounded by fire.
