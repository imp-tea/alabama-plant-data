Plant Name: Coral Honeysuckle (Lonicera sempervirens) – also called Trumpet Honeysuckle
General Description: A beautiful native honeysuckle vine that is mostly evergreen in Alabama. It twines to about 10–15 ft and has opposite bluish-green leaves (the topmost pairs often fused perfoliately around the stem). It produces clusters of slender, tubular flowers that are bright coral-red (with yellowish throats) from spring into summer. These are followed by small red berries in late summer/fall. Unlike invasive Japanese honeysuckle, coral honeysuckle is not aggressive and its stems are not hairy; it tends to stay in sunny open woods or fences.
Notable Characteristics: Renowned as a **hummingbird magnet** – its long red tubes are perfectly suited to hummingbird feeding and it blooms profusely in spring when hummers return. It is often recommended as a native alternative to Japanese honeysuckle since it offers nectar without smothering other plants. It can repeat-bloom through summer, though peak is spring. The berries are a glossy red and provide food for songbirds. The vine is generally disease-free and well-behaved, adding ornamental and wildlife value.
Preferred Environmental Conditions: Prefers full sun to partial sun. Occurs naturally at **woodland edges, open forests, and along trellising structures or fences**. Likes well-drained soil but with some moisture; does fine in sandy or loamy soils, and tolerates clay with decent drainage. In too much shade it will grow but flower less. It is semi-evergreen (holding leaves in winter) in the Deep South, which can give some winter interest and early spring photosynthesis.
Reproductive Method and Timing: Blooms in flushes from late spring through summer (in central AL often April through June with sporadic later blooms). The bright red trumpet-shaped flowers are loaded with nectar and are primarily pollinated by hummingbirds (especially Ruby-throated), as well as visited by butterflies and bees. Being red and unscented, it’s clearly adapted to hummingbird vision. If pollinated, small red berries develop in late summer. These berries ripen by fall and are usually eaten by birds (like American robins, hermit thrushes, and cedar waxwings) fairly quickly. Birds thus disperse the seeds short distances. The vine can also layer itself – if a trailing stem touches soil, it may root and start a new vine (though it doesn’t spread anywhere near as aggressively as Japanese honeysuckle).
Lifespan: Can live many years (20+ easily) in one spot if healthy. Over time the base can become woody. It doesn’t mind occasional pruning and can sprout anew from old wood, so it persists as a long-term component of the landscape.
Major Mutualistic/Parasitic Relationships: **Highly wildlife-friendly:** Coral honeysuckle’s vivid flowers are a prime nectar source for hummingbirds, butterflies, and moths. Hummingbirds receive energy from the nectar and in turn pollinate the flowers – a mutualistic win-win. It’s one of the first vines to bloom in spring, thus helping migrating hummingbirds fuel up. Bees (especially bumblebees) with long tongues may also access the nectar; smaller bees sometimes steal nectar via holes. The summer-to-fall berries, while not in huge clusters, are eaten by various birds (including songbirds like thrushes and sparrows), providing them nutrition and spreading the vine’s seeds. The evergreen to semi-evergreen foliage offers cover for small birds and insects year-round. Unlike invasive honeysuckle, coral honeysuckle doesn’t strangle host plants; it coexists without harming its supports. It can serve as a host plant for snowberry clearwing moth larvae (a type of hummingbird moth) and perhaps other Lepidoptera (though not widely documented as a larval host). It doesn’t have significant pests – deer rarely browse it heavily (some reports say it’s moderately deer resistant). All these factors make it a **stellar example of a native vine that supports pollinators and fruit-eating birds** with no real negative ecological impact.
