Plant Name: Longleaf Pine (Pinus palustris)
General Description: A large, long-lived evergreen conifer reaching 80–100 ft tall with extremely long needles (up to 18 inches) in bundles of three. Historically dominant in fire-maintained Southern pine savannas, it has thick fire-resistant bark and a sparse, open canopy.
Notable Characteristics: Seedlings persist for 5–12 years in a grass-like stage, staying low while developing deep roots, then rapidly shoot upward once established. It is the state tree of Alabama and an iconic symbol of the Southeastern coastal plain.
Preferred Environmental Conditions: Thrives on well-drained sandy or loamy soils in full sun. Highly adapted to frequent low-intensity fires – periodic burns reduce competition and expose the bare soil needed for its seeds to germinate. Tolerates drought and poor soils, but not prolonged flooding.
Reproductive Method and Timing: Wind-pollinated. Separate male and female cones are initiated in summer, pollinate the following spring, and mature 20 months later. Large seed crops occur every 3–5 years. Trees typically begin cone production around 20–30 years of age.
Lifespan: Exceptionally long-lived. Often 200–300 years, with some individuals reaching over 400 years. Full size is attained after a century or more of growth.
Major Mutualistic/Parasitic Relationships: Reliant on periodic fire (often set historically by humans) to maintain its open habitat (a fire-dependent mutualism). Its large, nutritious seeds are eaten and dispersed by wildlife such as birds and rodents. Mature longleaf pine stands provide critical nesting habitat for the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker, which excavates cavities in old, softened pine trunks. Like most pines, it associates with mycorrhizal fungi on its roots for nutrient uptake.
