Plant Name: Loblolly Pine (Pinus taeda)
General Description: A fast-growing evergreen pine common across Alabama, reaching about 80–100 ft with a straight trunk and a rounded crown. Needles are 6–9 inches long in clusters of three and remain on the tree ~3 years. It’s a major timber species in the Southeast.
Notable Characteristics: Adaptable to many sites – it grows on a variety of soils (except the very driest or wettest) and was historically found in moist bottomlands but now widely planted even on uplands. Young branches have a slight yellowish fuzz their first season. Cones are 3–6″ long with spines, and the tree’s flaky brown bark thickens with age.
Preferred Environmental Conditions: Grows best on moist, well-drained soils with moderate acidity, but tolerates poor drainage and clay. Prefers full sun and is intolerant of frequent fire (fire suppression in the last century enabled its spread into new areas).
Reproductive Method and Timing: Wind-pollinated. Male pollen cones appear in spring (March–May) and female cones mature by fall of the following year. Trees start producing cones as early as age 12–18, with viable seed yields by ~25 years. Good seed crops occur every 3–6 years. Dispersal is by wind; most seeds fall within 200 ft of the tree.
Lifespan: Medium-lived. Often 100–150 years in natural stands, rarely up to ~275 years under ideal conditions. However, most plantation-grown loblolly is harvested well before maturity.
Major Mutualistic/Parasitic Relationships: Provides important habitat and food – its canopy shelters wildlife, and many songbirds (e.g. pine warblers, yellow-throated warblers) nest in loblolly stands. The winged seeds are eaten by birds such as finches and by squirrels. Older pines with heartrot are essential nesting sites for the red-cockaded woodpecker (a commensal relationship). Loblolly pine is susceptible to outbreaks of southern pine beetle, a native bark beetle that can parasitize and kill weakened trees during epidemics.
