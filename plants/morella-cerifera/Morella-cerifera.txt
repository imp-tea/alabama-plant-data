Plant Name: Wax Myrtle (Morella cerifera) – also known as Southern Bayberry
General Description: An aromatic evergreen shrub to small tree, typically 6–12 ft tall (occasionally 20 ft). It has narrow, glossy olive-green leaves that are resinous and spicy-scented when crushed. Plants are dioecious. Female plants produce clusters of small, gray-white waxy berries along the stems in fall. Wax myrtle often grows in colonies and can form thickets in the coastal plain.
Notable Characteristics: Adapted to nutrient-poor soils by virtue of a **symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing actinobacteria (Frankia)** in its roots – it can improve soil fertility by fixing atmospheric nitrogen. The waxy berries were historically used to make bayberry candles (boiled for their fragrant wax). Leaves are semi-evergreen to evergreen and can act as a natural insect repellent. The plant has an informal, irregular habit but responds well to pruning (sometimes used as a screening hedge).
Preferred Environmental Conditions: Common in coastal and inland sandy areas – thrives in **poor, sandy or peaty soils** that are acidic. It tolerates both very wet sites (bogs, pond margins) and fairly dry, sandy scrub, as well as brackish conditions. Often found in pine flatwoods, marsh edges, and dunes. It prefers full sun to light shade. Very salt-spray tolerant (a hallmark shrub of maritime forests). Not cold-hardy much beyond Alabama’s zone (marginal in colder parts of state).
Reproductive Method and Timing: Dioecious. In spring, inconspicuous catkin-like flowers appear – male catkins release pollen to wind-pollinate female flowers. By late summer to fall, female plants develop clusters of round, wax-coated berries (about 1/8″ diameter) along one-year-old stems. These berry clusters often persist through winter if not eaten. Birds (like tree swallows, yellow-rumped warblers) consume the waxy fruit and disperse seeds in droppings. Wax myrtle can also spread vegetatively via suckers, enabling it to form clonal patches.
Lifespan: Moderate – individual stems might live 30–50 years, but the plant often regenerates by suckering, so clonal colonies can persist much longer.
Major Mutualistic/Parasitic Relationships: **Nitrogen fixer:** Wax myrtle’s roots harbor *Frankia* bacteria nodules that allow it to fix nitrogen from the air, enriching the soil for itself and neighboring plants. This gives it a competitive edge on barren soils. Its abundant berries are high in fat and serve as a vital winter food for many birds – especially the Yellow-rumped (Myrtle) Warbler, which is uniquely adapted to digest the waxy coating. Flocks of warblers and other songbirds (like catbirds, mockingbirds, bobwhite quail) descend on wax myrtles to feast on the fruits in late fall and winter, spreading seeds in return. The dense evergreen foliage also provides excellent cover and nesting sites for birds and small mammals. Additionally, wax myrtle exhibits **allelopathy** – its roots and leaf litter release chemicals that suppress competing plants, effectively giving it a “personal weed control” ability. This can create localized plant communities dominated by wax myrtle. Overall, wax myrtle is a keystone shrub in coastal ecosystems: it feeds wintering birds (warblers’ winter range is tightly linked to availability of Myrica berries), enriches soil with nitrogen, and even deters some plant competition – truly making its own luck.
