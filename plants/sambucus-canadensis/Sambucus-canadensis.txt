Plant Name: American Elderberry (Sambucus canadensis)
General Description: A fast-growing deciduous shrub typically 6–10 ft tall (can reach 12+ ft) with a broad, arching form and multiple stems. It has compound leaves (5–11 serrated leaflets) and produces large, flat-topped clusters of tiny white flowers in early summer. These are followed by dark purple-black berry clusters in late summer. The bark is light brown and warty on older stems. Elderberry often forms thickets via suckering.
Notable Characteristics: Sometimes called “elder bush” or “elder,” it is known for its prolific fruiting – the **edible berries** (when cooked) are used in jams, wines, and pies. Raw berries are mildy toxic to humans, but wildlife devour them. The white flower clusters are fragrant and also used for culinary purposes (elderflower cordial). Elderberry stems have a soft pith, and after the plant dies back, the hollow stems can provide bee nesting cavities.
Preferred Environmental Conditions: Moist, rich soils – commonly found along streams, pond edges, bottomland woods, and roadside ditches. Prefers full sun or partial sun; in too much shade it flowers and fruits less. Thrives in loamy, slightly acidic soils but tolerates clay and sandy loam. Often an early colonizer of wet disturbed sites. It appreciates consistent moisture but can handle short dry spells. Tolerant of occasional flooding. Because it spreads easily, elderberry often forms a hedgerow along fences and forest margins.
Reproductive Method and Timing: Reproduces by both seed and suckers. In Alabama, it blooms in late spring to mid-summer (May–July) with showy flat cymes of tiny star-shaped white flowers. These are pollinated by a wide variety of insects – bees, wasps, flies, and butterflies are all attracted to the blooms. By late summer (August–September), clusters of small purple-black berries (technically drupes) ripen. Birds quickly eat them, dispersing the seeds widely. Each berry contains 3–5 seeds. A single shrub can produce thousands of berries. Meanwhile, elderberry also spreads vegetatively: it sends up new shoots from roots and can form a dense colony over time if not managed. If cut or killed back (e.g. by frost), it vigorously resprouts.
Lifespan: Individual stems are relatively short-lived (5–10 years), often dying back, but the colony can persist much longer through continual renewal. An elderberry patch can thrive for decades as new suckers replace older stems.
Major Mutualistic/Parasitic Relationships: **Ultimate wildlife shrub.** The berries are a nutritious feast for wildlife – at least 45 species of birds feed on elderberries, including robins, bluebirds, catbirds, cedar waxwings, and grosbeaks. The fruits are high in sugars and vitamins and help fatten birds and small mammals in late summer. By consuming and excreting the seeds, birds disperse elderberry widely (some seeds can germinate after passing through digestive tracts). The white flowers are rich in pollen/nectar and attract numerous pollinators (honeybees, native bees, syrphid flies, butterflies – making it an important summer nectar source). **Host plant:** The foliage is a host for the caterpillars of some moths (e.g. Hermit Sphinx, Cecropia moth) and provides food for deer and rabbits (they browse leaves and twigs moderately). Additionally, the arching branches and thickets offer excellent nesting habitat and cover for birds, while **hollow elder stems provide nesting sites for small native bees** (gardeners often leave cut elder stems as bee hotels). Elderberry is fairly disease/pest free, though it can get powdery mildew or borers. All in all, it’s regarded as one of the **most wildlife-friendly native shrubs**, providing food (berries) and shelter in abundance.
