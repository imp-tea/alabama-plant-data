Plant Name: Green Ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica)
General Description: A fast-growing deciduous tree up to 50–80 ft tall, with a straight trunk and an oval crown. It has opposite pinnate leaves (typically 7–9 leaflets) that turn yellow in fall. Bark is gray-brown with interlacing ridges. Green ash (along with other ashes) is common in river bottoms and old fields in Alabama.
Notable Characteristics: Highly adaptable and once widely planted as a street tree. It tolerates wet soils and drought fairly well. Male and female flowers are on separate trees (dioecious) and are not showy (they appear as little purplish clusters before the leaves). Female trees produce clusters of paddle-shaped seeds (samaras) that drop in fall. Unfortunately, ashes are currently threatened by the non-native emerald ash borer insect, which has caused widespread mortality in other states.
Preferred Environmental Conditions: Often found in moist bottomlands, floodplain forests, and along streams, but also in upland forests and old fields. Prefers deep, rich soils with decent moisture, but can grow on a range of sites including drier or compacted soils. Full sun to partial shade. Green ash is hardy and tolerant of urban conditions (thus was frequently planted in towns). It is moderately flood-tolerant and also somewhat drought-tolerant once established.
Reproductive Method and Timing: Dioecious. In spring (March), before or as leaves emerge, tiny greenish or purple flowers appear in clusters on twigs. Since there are no petals, pollination is by wind. Female trees, if pollinated, produce abundant one-seeded samaras (winged seeds) that ripen in late summer and are shed through fall and winter. The seeds flutter to the ground or may be carried by wind or water. Ash trees begin producing seed at 8–10 years old and peak from ~30–50 years.
Lifespan: Medium – typically 80–120 years. Some may reach 150+. However, with the invasion of emerald ash borer, few ashes survive full lifespan if that pest is present.
Major Mutualistic/Parasitic Relationships: Green ash provides **valuable wildlife food and habitat**. Its winged seeds are eaten by various birds (e.g. finches, grouse, wild turkey) and small mammals. The tree’s foliage is browsed by deer and livestock to a degree (especially stump sprouts). Dozens of moth and butterfly species use ash as a larval host plant (e.g. tiger swallowtail butterflies often feed on ash). Ash wood’s tendency to develop cavities means older trees often become homes for woodpeckers and other cavity-nesters. Sadly, **emerald ash borer**, an invasive beetle, has been a lethal parasite – it bores through the cambium and can kill mature ashes. This pest threatens the mutualistic relationships that ashes supported. Green ash also associates with endophyte fungi that confer some pest resistance, but not enough against EAB. In summary, ash trees had been widespread and beneficial (seeds consumed by birds and squirrels, cover for wildlife), but now face severe decline from a parasitic insect.
