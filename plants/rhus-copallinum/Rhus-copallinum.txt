Plant Name: Winged Sumac (Rhus copallinum) – also known as Shining Sumac
General Description: A thicket-forming deciduous shrub or small tree, usually 5–15 ft tall. It has glossy dark-green **pinnate leaves** (leaflets have winged midrib, hence “winged” sumac) that turn brilliant red in autumn. In late summer it bears upright clusters of **rusty-red berry-like drupes** (dense cone-shaped panicles). The bark is smooth and gray-brown. Often colonizes open, dry areas in central Alabama.
Notable Characteristics: Known for its excellent fall color and its value in revegetating poor soils. The fruits are fuzzy, red, and tart (rich in vitamin C – sumac “lemonade” can be made). The plant spreads by root suckers to form clonal colonies or thickets. It’s also fire-tolerant by resprouting vigorously after burns. Often found on roadsides, old fields, and sunny clearings, sumac can be considered “weedy,” but it is highly beneficial to wildlife.
Preferred Environmental Conditions: Thrives in **dry, nutrient-poor soils** – sandy, rocky, or clay – where few other shrubs compete. Full sun to partial sun; it typically grows in open areas (prairies, savannas, woodland edges). Very drought-tolerant. Common along highway embankments, open pine lands, and disturbed sites. Tolerates acidic or neutral soils. Winged sumac can also handle fire regimes and is often part of post-fire regrowth.
Reproductive Method and Timing: **Dioecious or polygamdioecious** – plants mostly have separate sexes. In mid-summer (July), it produces yellow-green flower clusters at branch tips. These are rich in nectar and **attract hordes of pollinators**: bees, wasps, butterflies, and beetles flock to the blooms. If pollinated, female plants develop dense clusters of red fuzzy drupes by late summer (August–September). The fruits remain on the plant into winter unless eaten. Sumac spreads extensively via rhizomes; a single clone can cover large areas. Seeds are also distributed by animals and can germinate after passing through birds.
Lifespan: Individual stems might only live 20–30 years, but clonal colonies persist and expand indefinitely through root suckering. Sumac patches can be very long-lived, continuously renewing themselves.
Major Mutualistic/Parasitic Relationships: **Wildlife bonanza:** Winged sumac is a high-value wildlife plant. Its nutrient-rich red drupes feed dozens of species – wild turkeys, bobwhite quail, robins, bluebirds, and other songbirds rely on sumac berries, especially in late fall and winter when other foods are scarce. The fruits are acidic but palatable after frost (many birds eat them after freezes). White-tailed deer and rabbits browse the twigs and bark, particularly in winter. Sumac is also a **larval host** for several Lepidoptera: e.g. the Red-banded Hairstreak butterfly lays eggs on sumac leaf litter (the larvae feed on decaying leaves). Additionally, Luna moth caterpillars have been recorded feeding on sumac foliage. The summer flowers are a major nectar source supporting countless pollinators and beneficial insects. In effect, sumac thickets function as natural “edge” habitat – providing food (nectar, fruit) and cover for wildlife. While it can be aggressive, this native shrub is critical for birds and insects. (No serious parasitic issues – some leaf spot fungi or aphids may occur, but nothing significant. The plant’s tannin-rich foliage deters most insect herbivory.) Sumac’s role is firmly mutualistic in ecosystems: offering food and shelter to animals, which in turn help disperse its seeds.
