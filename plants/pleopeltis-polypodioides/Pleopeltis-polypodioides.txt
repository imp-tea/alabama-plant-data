Plant Name: Resurrection Fern (Pleopeltis polypodioides)
General Description: A small epiphytic fern often seen carpeting the branches of large oak trees (and other trees) in the Southeast. Fronds are 2–6 inches long, leathery, and deeply divided. In wet conditions, they are green and lush; in dry spells, they appear brown, curled, and dead – but “resurrect” (turn green and active) within hours after a rain, hence the name. They typically grow on tree bark, logs, rock surfaces, or even old wooden structures, obtaining moisture from the air and rain.
Notable Characteristics: Has an amazing ability to survive extreme dehydration. It can lose up to ~95% of its water content and remain alive in a dormant state. For comparison, most plants die after 10-20% water loss. As soon as rain returns, it rehydrates and resumes photosynthesis, seemingly coming back to life. This adaptation allows it to thrive as an epiphyte. It attaches via a rhizome with small root-like structures to its substrate (but it’s not parasitic; it doesn't take nutrients from the host tree, only uses it for support). It’s often found alongside Spanish moss and air plants in the canopy in more humid parts of Alabama (especially southern and central parts).
Preferred Environmental Conditions: Partial shade (filtered light) and a humid microclimate. Common on large tree limbs in hardwood swamps, maritime forests, and damp woodlands. It favors rough-barked trees (like live oaks, magnolias, cypresses) to anchor its rhizomes. Needs frequent atmospheric moisture or periodic rains – thrives in high humidity areas. It does not survive prolonged drought unless in a very shaded, moist hollow. In central AL, it's at the northern edge of where it’s common (particularly in riverine forests). Freezes can kill the fronds, but the rhizomes often survive on the bark and produce new fronds. Essentially, it likes a stable host in a stable microenvironment (often the micro-ecosystem of a large old tree).
Reproductive Method and Timing: Like most ferns, it reproduces via spores. On the underside of fertile fronds, it produces rows of brown sporangia (sori) which release spores typically in warm, moist times of year (summer). These tiny spores can drift on air currents. If a spore lands in a hospitable spot (damp tree bark or rock crevice), it can germinate into a gametophyte (the tiny intermediary stage) which then facilitates fertilization and grows into a new fern. Vegetatively, the fern also spreads gradually by creeping rhizomes – a single individual can slowly cover expanses of bark (you’ll often see mats of clones covering a branch).
Lifespan: Potentially many years or decades for an established colony. Since it suffers little from herbivory or disease, its main threat is loss of habitat (cutting of host limb or tree, or extended drought). But given a steady environment, it can persist indefinitely, cycling between dry/dormant and wet/active states.
Major Mutualistic/Parasitic Relationships: **Epiphytic commensalism:** Resurrection ferns are classic epiphytes – they perch on trees for support but typically do not harm the host tree (they don’t rob it of water or nutrients, only using the surface). So their relationship with host trees is commensal: the fern benefits (gaining a habitat up in the canopy to access moisture and light) while the tree is generally unaffected. In fact, on massive live oak limbs, some studies suggest epiphytes like resurrection fern and Spanish moss might slightly **benefit the tree by retaining moisture** on the bark and insulating against extreme heat and cold. On the flip side, a very heavy load of epiphytes could possibly marginally increase limb weight or shade some leaves, but usually not enough to be detrimental. The fern itself supports small micro-fauna: its mats collect leaf litter and dust which harbor microbes and tiny invertebrates (like mites, springtails, etc.), essentially creating a mini-forest floor on the branch. These invertebrates might aid the fern by contributing nutrients when they die or excrete (a mini nutrient cycle on the branch). When the fern fronds curl up in drought, they can rehydrate from not just rain but also dew and even directly absorb moisture from humid air (some evidence shows **foliar water uptake** helps them recover). In doing so, they slightly increase humidity around the bark when they rehydrate, possibly benefiting the host tree’s microclimate in return. Because they are non-parasitic, they coexist peacefully with their hosts. In extreme drought, they go dormant rather than compete for water (since they rely on rain, not the tree's water). Also, their presence adds to **biodiversity** – they are part of a community of epiphytes that provide cover or foraging substrate for tree frogs, lizards, and insects. For instance, tree frogs may hide under curled dry fronds, and upon rain, as fronds open and collect water, small creatures may drink from them – a subtle mutualism by providing a water source in the canopy. No known animal exclusively feeds on resurrection fern (likely due to tough fronds and unpalatability), so herbivory is negligible. In summary, resurrection fern’s relationships are mostly commensal or slight mutualist: it **takes nothing vital from its host besides space, while potentially giving a bit of moisture retention to the host and habitat for canopy critters**. Its most remarkable relationship is with the environment – the ability to “mutually interact” with dry/wet cycles by essentially playing dead then reviving. From a human perspective, it’s a symbol of resilience, often pointed out to kids after rain – not a direct ecological mutualism, but it fosters appreciation for nature’s wonders, which can encourage conservation of its host trees.
